## TODO:
- [x] ~~Create raw amplitude visualizer.~~
- [x] ~~Create non scaled frequency visualizer.~~
- [x] ~~Modify frequency visualizer to be scalable.~~
- [x] ~~Create spectrum visualizer for the whole song.~~
- [x] ~~Modify frequency visualizer to be scalable.~~
- [x] ~~Get bin average from the whole song.~~
- [x] ~~Remember time-frequency points.~~
- [x] Create time-frequency fiftlets: leading + 4
- [x] Create addresses (triplets) from time-fequency fiftlets: -3rd position
- [x] Connect addresses with doubles (abs time of anchor; songID)
- [x] OPTIONAL: Modify addresses and time-frequency points into integers
- [x] Secure time coherency
